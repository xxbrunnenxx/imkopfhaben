# Followup Product Introduction

Followup is a place to capture your thoughts — whether it's an idea, a to-do, or just a note. Record what's on your mind at that light-bulb moment, before it slips away, and Followup helps you organize it afterward. With a local AI server on your own network, your recordings are transcribed and summarized automatically. Everything is stored on your SD card.

It runs on the [Waveshare ESP32-S3-ePaper-3.97](https://docs.waveshare.com/ESP32-S3-ePaper-3.97), so your thoughts live on a quiet, always-on screen you can place anywhere — a constant, low-interruption reminder instead of one more notification buried in your phone.

## One-Sentence Positioning

**Followup is a voice-first thought-capture companion on always-on ePaper: record ideas, to-dos, and notes in the moment, let a local AI server transcribe and summarize them, and keep the ones that matter in front of you as stickies.**

## What It Is Suitable For

- Capturing a sudden idea by voice at the light-bulb moment, before it's forgotten
- Jotting quick to-dos and notes hands-free while you're in the middle of something else
- Keeping a small, always-visible set of follow-ups on a desk, fridge, or wall
- Revisiting past ideas later to decide what's still worth pursuing
- Anyone who wants their thoughts organized without living inside another app on their phone

## Key Features

### 1. Capture at the Light-Bulb Moment

Press record and speak. Every capture starts as a voice recording, tagged as an **Idea**, a **To-do**, or a **Note**, so you can get the thought down the instant it arrives without stopping to type.

### 2. Local AI Transcription and Summarization

Once a recording is saved, a local AI server on your network transcribes the audio and summarizes it — turning a rambling voice memo into readable text and a concise summary you can scan at a glance.

A local AI server on the same network is required (this fork targets a household server running LM Studio with google/gemma-4-e2b for summaries and faster-whisper for transcription -- see docs/local-ai-service.md). No cloud account, no API key, no usage limits.

### 3. Everything Stored on Your SD Card

Recordings, transcripts, and summaries are stored locally on the device's SD card. Your thoughts stay with you, on your own storage.

### 4. Vibe-Check Your Ideas

Ideas don't all age well. Review each one and decide whether it's still a vibe worth keeping — or something to trash so you can move on with a clear head.

### 5. Follow Up on Tasks and Notes

Mark a task or note as a follow-up to keep it on your radar. Followup helps you stay on track and focused on what actually needs doing next.

### 6. Display Your Follow-Ups as Stickies

Pin your follow-ups to the ePaper display as sticky notes. Because the screen is always on and low-power, they stay in front of you as a constant, gentle reminder.

## Controls

Followup is driven entirely by the three physical controls: a rocker, the BOOT button, and the PWR button.

| Control | Action |
| --- | --- |
| Rocker up / down | Move the selection; hold to repeat |
| Rocker down, held | Back out of a list or card you have entered |
| Rocker middle | Select / confirm |
| BOOT, tap | Select / confirm |
| BOOT, press and hold | Record — recording starts on the hold and stops when you let go |
| PWR, tap | Lock the screen, or unlock it |
| PWR, hold ~1s | Open the shutdown confirmation |
| PWR, hold 6s | Hardware power-off, straight from the PMIC |

Recording is exclusive to BOOT, so no other control can start or stop a capture by accident. The 6-second PWR hold bypasses the firmware entirely and always cuts power.

## Product Value Summary

The value of Followup is a quiet, always-visible place to catch your thoughts and keep the important ones in front of you. Instead of losing an idea to a forgotten note app or burying a task in a notification stream, you speak it in the moment, let your local AI server turn it into clean text and a summary, and keep everything private on your SD card and your own network.

Ideas get a vibe check so you only carry forward what still matters. Tasks and notes become follow-ups so you stay on track. And the ones you care about most sit on the ePaper as stickies — a steady, low-interruption reminder of what's next.
